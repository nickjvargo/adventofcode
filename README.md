### Welcome to my repository for Advent of Code 2020 solutions!

I hope you find my answers clear and easy to follow.

I am an aspiring developer taking Java classes at Columbus State Community College while working full time.
Since we were given a winter break, I thought that these problems would be a nice way for me to continue my studies
as well as challenge myself =) Enjoy!
